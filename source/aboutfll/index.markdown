The FLL(First Lego League) tournament is where children from ages 9-14 work in groups of 3 or more to solve a challenge.
A new challenge is announced every year on September 5th, and this year the challenge was to help seniors - Senior Solutions.
There are three parts to the competition - the robot game itself, the project, and Core Values (teamwork).

## The Robot Game

The robot game is where the teams design a robot that can move around the board and perform missions.
Some of the missions this year (2012) were a cardiovascular machine, bowling (an activity many seniors enjoy) and two high and low shelves with one yellow hoop on each platform to symbolize getting objects from hard to reach places.

## The Project

The project is where the teams find a problem by talking to multiple people related to the problem and then devising a solution.
A project for this year could be a better kind of walking stick, pill box, hearing aids, and more.
The Octobots chose to work on the problem of reaching for out of reach objects, and came up with robotic shelves. (For more, go to *Peninsula Regional 2012 link* and scroll to the Project section)

## Core Values

The Core Values part of the FLL competition is judging how well each team works together, and whether they understand the concept of Gracious Professionalism.
The Octobots defined Gracious Professionalism as working with other teams - helping them out with their problems, but still competing in that the team trys hard and works to devise a good solution to each problem they come across.

#### The FLL definition of Gracious Professionalism is:

"Gracious Professionalism is part of the ethos of FIRST. It's a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process. They avoid treating anyone like losers. No chest thumping tough talk, but no sticky-sweet platitudes either. Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended. In the long run, Gracious Professionalism is part of pursuing a meaningful life. One can add to society and enjoy the satisfaction of knowing one has acted with integrity and sensitivity."
