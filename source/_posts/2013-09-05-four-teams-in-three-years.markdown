This is the fourth year of the PaloBots club, and with it two new teams launch to beat Nature's Fury.  The new teams will only have two
kids returning from any of the previous years.  We do not show publicly much about the kids during the seasons, but with four teams
gone by, it seems like at least a few pictures are in order now.

The four teams over the last three years are:

   * #336 -- TimeBots -- 2010
   * #6763 -- Lightning Bolts -- 2011
   * #78 -- SwineBots -- 2011
   * #8 -- OctoBots -- 2012

And some pictures of them are below.  Hope they all had a great time and learned a lot.
