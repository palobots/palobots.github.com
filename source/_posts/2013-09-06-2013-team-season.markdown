The 2013 team season of the PaloBots started a couple weeks ago with the release of the Nature's Fury challenge (see
<http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge/2013naturesfury> ).  We have built the Field Set:

and have two teams working on the challenge:

   * Team #7: Samurai, Deadly Kids, Never Say Never, ...
   * Team #159: Hurricanes, ...

Busy, busy, busy...
