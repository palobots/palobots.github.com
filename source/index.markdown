PaloBots is a club that helps kids learn about robotics, programming, technology, and teamwork.  Our mission is:

   * To enable 'rookie' kids to become familiar with robotics, problem solving, and the basics of teamwork
   * To enable more experienced & committed kids to learn exceptional skills in robot design, team organization & leadership, public presentation, and other aspects
   * For any responsible kid (& parents) in the general Palo Alto area

PaloBots is meant to be "Serious Fun" -- kids should be having fun while they are seriously focused on learning a wealth of new things.

PaloBots has both a club and a team period.  During the team period we have run four teams over the last three years:

   * Team #8: The Octobots (2012 season)
   * Team #78: The Swinebots (2011 season)
   * Team #6763: The Lightning Bolts (2011 season)
   * Team #336: The Timebots (2010 season)
